# PAMPA sequences

This repository contains a curated database of **COL1A1** (Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain) and **COL1A2** (Collagen Type I Alpha 2 Chain) sequences commonly used in **ZooMS** (*Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry*). 

The sequences were retrieved from **NCBI** and selected based on the following criteria:

- Presence of the full-length mature collagen region  
- Inclusion of the most common ZooMS peptide markers  
- Consistency of predicted mass with values reported in the literature, when available

The resulting peptide markers are available on [PAMPA's repository](https://github.com/touzet/pampa).
